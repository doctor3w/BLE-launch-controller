# BLE-launch-controller
A BLE launch controller code and setup for an Arduino for a model rocket electric launcher. 



This project requires multiple components, such as the RedBearLab BLE Shield v2.1. 

A full tutorial will be available eventually, but for now, the code is here for anyone who wants to see how to launch a rocket with an arduino, wirelessly. 



### Todo 

- Set launch code from connected device.
